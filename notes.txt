uhh, how much work would it be to get a basic HN clone running?
- setup a database, sqlite would probably be fine
- account management (login, users, admins)
- posts and threads
- post feeds
- anti-spam
- web interface

I should do the interface first, that's the easiest one,
at least that achieves my minimum goal of demonstrating
lua as a viable templating engine.

And as a side TODO, I should do a proper alternative 
go implementation to moon-temple, drop-in replacement
fully compatible with the redbean runtime.
Why? It's easier to have a dev setup with the go tooling,
and I get a proper filesystem monitoring. But the redbean
runtime stays.
